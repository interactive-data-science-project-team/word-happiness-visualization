<h3>Completeness</h3>
<p>
    <b>Are there junk values or missing values?</b>
    There are some missing entries (<code>na</code>) in the original dataset (see table
    below), especially for GINI index (63% of the data do not have the corresponding
    World bank estimated GINI index). Some survey questions are not asked in certain countries. 
    For example, the perception of corruption is not asked in China. 
    This results in missing values for these attributes for all years in some countries.
    This may introduce some bias into the data when we perform further analysis using techniques like regression analysis. 
    Other columns have few missing entries.

        <p>
            We examined the number of reports each year by country, and we find
            that
            there are significantly less reports collected before 2007 (see the
            table below).

    <b>How did we handle missing entries?</b> We did preliminary data cleaning
    using
    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>.
    If we have missing data for an
    attribute, we try to use the last valid observation from the same country to
    fill in
    the missing values, <code>df.groupby('country',
    as_index=False).fillna(method='ffill')</code>.
    If this fails, we try to use the next valid observation to fill
    in the missing values, <code>df.groupby('country',
    as_index=False).fillna(method='bfill')</code>. It's possible that some
    attributes were not
    collected for some countries for the entire time period such as the
    "perception of corruption" attribute for China. In such cases, we leave
    the values as <code>na</code>. The table below show the number of
    <code>na</code>
    's
    before and after the data cleaning.

    <b>Is the data relevant?</b> If we want to train a regression model using
    happiness scores in 2017 as labels and other variates as covariates,
    then the dataset demonstrates strong correlation between the explanatory variables
    and the world happiness score, (in the table below, we show scatterplots between
    the world happiness score and a subset of predictors).

    Alternatively, if we
    want to study how happiness score changes over time in a country, we can model the
    happiness score for a country as a time series over the years. We show a
    line chart which depicts how happiness scores of five happiest countries
    changed in the past few years.
